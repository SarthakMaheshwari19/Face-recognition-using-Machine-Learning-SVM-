Problem Statement:
Use classification in machine learning to make a model

Description:
This project showcases the design and implementation of a facial recognition system using Python's SVM (Support Vector Machine) machine learning technique. The system utilizes a dataset containing images of Indian political leaders for training and testing purposes. The SVM model, trained on OpenCV for extracting facial features, demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and web development.

The system features a Flask web interface for image classification, providing a user-friendly platform for facial recognition in the political realm. With an accuracy rate of around 75%, the system offers reliable and accurate identification of political leaders based on facial features. This project highlights the integration of machine learning techniques with web development, enabling efficient and effective facial recognition applications
